Motivation: As new and returning residents of New York, we are interested in the bustling rat population around us and across each borough. We want to know which areas of the city to avoid and which areas may have the world's best ratatouille. We intend to use a rat sightings dataset made publicly available by NYC Open Data (https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe/data). We anticipate some coding challenges relating to creating readable/interpretable rat sighting maps of New York with a large amount of data.
